# Hello, world!
*Hello, world!* is a bootcamp for teenagers in low socio-economic areas. The end goal is for the participants to:
1) have their own sites live on the Web with github.io
2) be able to write basic Python programs, run them from the command line and store them on GitHub
3) be excited about the Web and building things with software

The participants who, by the end of this bootcamp, have achieved the above shall be supported in keeping on learning and developing their skills.
