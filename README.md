# Hello, world!
> *Hello, world!* is an event that gets teenagers from low socio-economic backgrounds on the Web, as creators.

The end goal is for the participants to:
1) have their own sites live on the Web (with github.io?)
2) be able to write basic Python programs, run them from the command line and store them on GitHub
3) get excited about the Web and building things with software

The participants who, by the end of this bootcamp, have achieved the above shall be supported in keeping on learning and developing their skills.

- has a basic understanding of the Web (i.e. HTTP, HTML)
